# Handle nftables.conf. We can't provide nftables.conf via the ragnarok-base
# package since it's already provided by nftables. That said, the config file
# provided by the nftables package is not good enough, period. Let's 'cat' 
# our own file to /etc/nftables.conf and give it a 700 permission. Hacky, but
# that's how it's done.
