# Script to automatically build/update the packages in the source tree.

# Global variables

usage() {
	printf '%s\n' "
Build or update one or more package. Valid options:

-a	create a tar.gz archive of the ports tree. If /path/to/sec_key is
	given as argument 1, then the archive will be signed with signify.
-b	build package(s)
-h	print this help message
-s	sign package(s) with signify
-t	custom target where .debs and SHA256(.sig) should go
-u	update package(s)

For the -b and -u options, one or more package can be supplied
as arguments. When no package name is given, then all packages
are built/signed/updated. The -s option does not take any package
as an argument since the SHA256(.sig) files need to be regenerated
after a package was updated.

Example usage:

Build and sign all packages and move everything to a directory in .local/packages:
./mkpkg -t /home/<USERNAME>/.local/packages -b -s

Update and sign a single package:
./mkpkg -u oksh
