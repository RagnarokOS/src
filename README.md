About
-----

Ragnarok is a small project which aims to create a simple, Unix-like and
hardened Debian by default.

The project's underlying goals are a) to create tools and an infrastructure
which helps building heavily customized Debian installs and [live ISOs](https://github.com/RagnarokOS/iso)
in the most straightforward and reusable way possible, and b) exepriment
with various forms of OS hardening.

Everything created by this project is meant to be perfectly usable on their
own, for whatever purpose someone might need them for. In essence, Ragnarok
the distribution is merely an example of what can be achived by utilizing
one, or all of these tools.
