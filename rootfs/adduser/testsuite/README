testsuite.README

1) Create with [c]debootstrap a debian chroot

2) Copy the testsuite-files into this chroot; the testsuite doesn't have any
dependencies except (you probably know it already) adduser :-)

3) execute "run-suite.sh"; the testsuite outputs the adduser call which are
checked. If an error happens, you are noticed of the failed check.

4) Remove the debian chroot, because the testsuite creates a lot of users,
homedirectories and so on, but doesn't clear them all. Of course you can run
the testsuite more than once in that debian chroot, but don't reuse this chroot
for any other purpose than running this tests.
