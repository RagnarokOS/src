and 
.BR delgroup(8) .
Each option takes the form
.IR option " = " value .
Double or single quotes are allowed around the value.  Comment lines
must have a hash sign (#) at the beginning of the line.

.B deluser(8) 
and 
.B delgroup(8) 
also read 
.I /etc/adduser.conf,
see 
.B adduser.conf(5); 
settings in

Removes the home directory and mail spool of the user to be removed.
Value may be 0 (don't delete) or 1 (do delete).
.TP
\fBREMOVE_ALL_FILES\fP
Removes all files on the system owned by the user to be removed.
If this option is activated
.B REMOVE_HOME
has no effect. Values may be 0 or 1.
.TP
\fBBACKUP\fP
If
.B REMOVE_HOME
or
.B REMOVE_ALL_FILES
is activated all files are backuped before they are removed. The backup
file that is created defaults to username.tar(.gz|.bz2) in the

Values may be 0 or 1.
.TP
\fBBACKUP_TO\fP

.B BACKUP_TO
specifies the directory the backup is written to. Default is the
current directory.
.TP
\fBNO_DEL_PATHS\fP
A list of regular expressions, space separated. All files to be
deleted in course of deleting home directories or deleting files owned
by the user to be deleted are checked against each of these regular
expressions. If a match is detected, the file is not deleted. Defaults
to a list of system directories, leaving only /home.

In other words: By default only files below /home belonging to that specific user are going to be deleted.

Only delete a group if there are no users belonging to this group. Defaults to 0.
.TP
\fBEXCLUDE_FSTYPES\fP
A regular expression which describes all file systems which should be excluded when looking for files of a user to be deleted. Defaults to "(proc|sysfs|usbfs|devpts|tmpfs|afs)".
