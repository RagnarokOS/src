hardened-malloc for Debian
-------------------------

GrapheneOS' hardened memory allocator. This package provides the source code and
a post-install script which will compile all three variants in order to take
advantage of the --march=native option. On Ragnarok, hardened_malloc will be
enabled by default at system installed time. Otherwise, enabling/starting the
init script will enable it.
