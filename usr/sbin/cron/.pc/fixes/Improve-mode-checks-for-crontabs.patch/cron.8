.TH CRON 8 "20 December 1993"

.SH NAME
cron \- daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)
.SH SYNOPSIS
cron
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I cron
is started automatically from /etc/init.d on entering multi-user
runlevels.
.SH NOTES
.PP
.I cron
searches its spool area /var/cron/tabs for crontab
files (which are named after accounts in
/etc/passwd); crontabs found are loaded into memory.  Note that
crontabs in this directory should not be accessed directly -
the
.I crontab
command should be used to access and update them.

.I cron
also reads /etc/crontab, which is in a slightly different format (see
.IR crontab (5)).
.I cron
then wakes up every minute, examining all stored crontabs, checking
each command to see if it should be run in the current minute.  When
executing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab
(or to the user named in the MAILTO environment variable in the
crontab, if such exists).  The children copies of cron running these
processes have their name coerced to uppercase, as will be seen in the
syslog and ps output.
.PP
Additionally,
.I cron
checks each minute to see if its spool directory's modtime (or the modtime
on the
.I /etc/crontab
file)
has changed, and if it has,
.I cron
will then examine the modtime on all crontabs and reload those which have
changed.  Thus
.I cron
need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is modified.  Note that the
.IR crontab (1)
command updates the modtime of the spool directory whenever it changes a
crontab.
.I cron
logs its action to the syslog facility 'cron', and logging may be
controlled using the standard
.IR syslogd (8)
facility.
