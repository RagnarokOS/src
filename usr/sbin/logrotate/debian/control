Description: Log rotation utility
 The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
 log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate
 allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
 log files.  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
 monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  Normally, logrotate
 runs as a daily cron job.
