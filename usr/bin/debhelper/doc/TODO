v10:

* escaping in config files (for whitespace)?

Deprecated:

* dh_installmanpages.
* dh_movefiles. I won't hold my breath. Have not added deprecation
  docs or message yet.
* dh_installinit --init-script (make it warn)
* dh_clean -k
* -s flag, not formally deprecated yet; remove eventually
* -u flag; add a warning on use and remove eventually
* delsubstvar() and the last parameter to addsubstvar that makes it remove
  a string are not used in debhelper itself, but have been left in the
  library in case other things use them. Deprecate and remove.
* debian/compress files

Also, grep the entire archive for all dh_* command lines,
and check to see what other switches are not being used, and maybe remove
some of them.
