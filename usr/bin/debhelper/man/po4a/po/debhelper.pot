msgid ""
"Debhelper is used to help you build a Debian package. The philosophy behind "
"debhelper is to provide a collection of small, simple, and easily understood "
"tools that are used in F<debian/rules> to automate various common aspects of "
"building a package. This means less work for you, the packager.  It also, to "
"some degree means that these tools can be changed if Debian policy changes, "
"and packages that use them will require only a rebuild to comply with the "
"new policy."
msgstr ""

"A typical F<debian/rules> file that uses debhelper will call several "
"debhelper commands in sequence, or use L<dh(1)> to automate this "
"process. Examples of rules files that use debhelper are in "
"F</usr/share/doc/debhelper/examples/>"
msgstr ""

#. type: textblock
#: debhelper.pod:25

"To create a new Debian package using debhelper, you can just copy one of the "
"sample rules files and edit it by hand. Or you can try the B<dh-make> "
"package, which contains a L<dh_make|dh_make(1)> command that partially "
"automates the process. For a more gentle introduction, the B<maint-guide> "
"Debian package contains a tutorial about making your first package using "
"debhelper."

"Many debhelper commands make use of files in F<debian/> to control what they "
