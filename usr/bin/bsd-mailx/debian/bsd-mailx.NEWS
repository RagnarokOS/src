bsd-mailx (8.1.2-0.20160123cvs-4) unstable; urgency=medium

   Since this version MIME headers are added to every outgoing mail
   to indicate the correct local charset (from the POSIX locale)
   and transfer encoding (always 8bit).

   See "Character sets and MIME" in bsd-mailx(1) man page
   and Bug#859935 for more information.
