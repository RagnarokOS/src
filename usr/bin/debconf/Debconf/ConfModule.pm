Debconf::ConfModule - communicates with a ConfModule

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a configuration module communication package for the Debian
configuration management system. It can launch a configuration module
script (hereafter called a "confmodule") and communicate with it. Each
instance of a ConfModule is connected to a separate, running confmodule.

There are a number of methods that are called in response to commands
from the client. Each has the same name as the command, with "command_"
prepended, and is fed in the parameters given after the command (split on
whitespace), and whatever it returns is passed back to the configuration
module. Each of them are described below.

=head1 FIELDS

=over 4

=item frontend

The frontend object that is used to interact with the user.

=item version

The protocol version spoken.

=item pid

The PID of the confmodule that is running and talking to this object, if
any.

=item write_handle

Writes to this handle are sent to the confmodule.

=item read_handle

Reads from this handle read from the confmodule.

=item caught_sigpipe

Set if we have caught a SIGPIPE signal. If it is set, the value of the
field should be returned, rather than the normal exit code.

=item client_capb

An array reference. If set, it will hold the capabilities the confmodule
reports.

=item seen

An array reference. If set, it will hold a list of all questions that have
ever been shown to the user in this confmodule run.

=item busy

An array reference. If set, it will hold a list of named of question that are
"busy" -- in the process of being shown, that cannot be unregistered right now.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=cut

# Here I define all the numeric result codes that are used.
my %codes = (
	success => 0,
	escaped_data => 1,
	badparams => 10,

	input_invisible => 30,
	version_bad => 30,
	go_back => 30,
	progresscancel => 30,
	internalerror => 100,
);

=item init

Called when a ConfModule is created.

=cut

sub init {
	my $this=shift;

	# Protcol version.
	$this->version("2.0");
	
	$this->owner('unknown') if ! defined $this->owner;

	# (eg, because it was dealing earlier with a confmodule that could),
	# tell it otherwise.

	$this->seen([]);
	$this->busy([]);

	# Let clients know a FrontEnd is actually running.
	$ENV{DEBIAN_HAS_FRONTEND}=1;
}

=item startup

Pass this name name of a confmodule program, and it is started up. Any
further options are parameters to pass to the confmodule. You generally need
to do this before trying to use any of the rest of this object. The
alternative is to launch a confmodule manually, and connect the read_handle
and write_handle fields of this object to it.

=cut

sub startup {
	my $this=shift;
	my $confmodule=shift;

	# There is an implicit clearing of any previously pending questions
	# when a new confmodule is run.

	$SIG{PIPE}=sub { $this->caught_sigpipe(128) };
}

=item communicate

Read one command from the confmodule, process it, and respond
to it. Returns true unless there were no more commands to read.
This is typically called in a loop. It in turn calls various
command_* methods.

=cut

sub communicate {
	my $this=shift;

	my $r=$this->read_handle;
	$_=<$r> || return $this->finish;

=item escape

Escape backslashes and newlines for output via the debconf protocol.

=cut

whitespace.

}

=item process_command

Pass in a raw command, and it will be processed and handled.

	}
	return $ret;
}

=item finish

Waits for the child process (if any) to finish so its return code can be
examined.  The return code is stored in the exitcode field of the object.
It also marks all questions that were shown as seen.

=cut

=item command_go

Tells the associated FrontEnd to display items to the user, by calling
its go method. That method should return false if the user asked to back
up, and true otherwise. If it returns true, then all of the questions that
were displayed are added to the seen array.

=item command_subst

This must be passed a question name, a key, and a value. It sets up variable
substitutions on the questions description so all instances of the key

Pass this a question name, and it will give up ownership of the question,
which typically causes it to be removed.

This will give up ownership of all questions a confmodule owns.

=item command_info

Pass this a question name. It displays the given template as an out-of-band
informative message. Unlike inputting a note, this doesn't require an
acknowledgement from the user, and depending on the frontend it may not even
be displayed at all. Frontends should display the info persistently until
some other info comes along.

With no arguments, this resets the info message to a default value.

}

=item command_progress

Progress bar handling. Pass this a subcommand name followed by any arguments
required by the subcommand, as follows:

=over 4

=item START

Pass this a minimum value, a maximum value, and a question name. It creates
a progress bar with the specified range and the description of the specified
question as the title.

=item SET

Pass this a value. It sets the current position of the progress bar to the
specified value.

=item STEP

Pass this an increment. It increments the current position of the progress
bar by the specified amount.

=item INFO

Pass this a template name. It displays the specified template as an
informational message in the progress bar.

=item STOP

This subcommand takes no arguments. It destroys the progress bar.

=back

Note that the frontend's progress_set, progress_step, and progress_info 
functions should return true, unless the progress bar was canceled.
