"The worst of these involves getting the config script to run. The way that "

"configured. Then, when the postinst script runs, it starts up debconf again. "
"Debconf notices it is being used by the postinst script, and so it goes off "
"and runs the config script. This can only work if your postinst loads up one "
"of the debconf libraries though, so postinsts always have to take care to do "
"that. We hope to address this later by adding explicit support to dpkg for "
"debconf. The B<debconf>(1)  program is a step in this direction."

"A related hack is getting debconf running when a config script, postinst, or "
"other program that uses it starts up. After all, they expect to be able to "
"talk to debconf right away. The way this is accomplished for now is that "
"when such a script loads a debconf library (like /usr/share/debconf/"
"confmodule), and debconf is not already running, it is started up, and a new "
"copy of the script is re-execed. The only noticeable result is that you need "
"to put the line that loads a debconf library at the very top of the script, "
"or weird things will happen. We hope to address this later by changing how "
"debconf is invoked, and turning it into something more like a transient "
"daemon."

"It's rather hackish how debconf figures out what templates files to load, "
"and when it loads them. When the config, preinst, and postinst scripts "
"invoke debconf, it will automatically figure out where the templates file "
"is, and load it. Standalone programs that use debconf will cause debconf to "
"look for templates files in /usr/share/debconf/templates/progname."
"templates.  And if a postrm wants to use debconf at purge time, the "
"templates won't be available unless debconf had a chance to load them in its "
"postinst. This is messy, but rather unavoidable. In the future some of these "
"programs may be able to use debconf-loadtemplate by hand though."

"Debconf sets DEBCONF_RECONFIGURE=1 before running postinst scripts, so a "
