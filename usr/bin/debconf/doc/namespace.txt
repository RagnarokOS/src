Questions and templates both exist in a hierarchical namespace. It can be
arbitrarily deep, and is separated by '/' characters, like a unix directory
hierarchy. Here are the conventions we're using so far to divide up the
namespace.

package/*	- This is the property of a single package, and can be
		  subdivided however that package wants to.

shared/foo/*	- This holds items that are shared between several packages.
		  "foo" is replaced by a name that relates to all of them. For
		  example, news grabbers and readers all can use 
		  shared/news/server to store the news server they use.

Currently the following shared templates and questions exist:

shared/news/server	- Prompt for hostname of the news server.
shared/mailname		- Prompt for contents of /etc/mailname
