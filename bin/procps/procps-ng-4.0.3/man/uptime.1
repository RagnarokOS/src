.TH UPTIME "1" "December 2012" "procps-ng" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
uptime \- Tell how long the system has been running.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uptime
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B uptime
gives a one line display of the following information.  The current time, how
long the system has been running, how many users are currently logged on, and
the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
.PP
This is the same information contained in the header line displayed by
.BR w (1).
.PP
System load averages is the average number of processes that are either in a
runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is either
using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in uninterruptable state
is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are taken
over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the
number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system
is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of
the time.
