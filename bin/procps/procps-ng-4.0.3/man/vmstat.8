.TH VMSTAT 8 "2023-01-18" "procps-ng" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
vmstat \- Report virtual memory statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vmstat
[options]
.RI [ delay " [" count ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vmstat
reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, disks
and cpu activity.
.PP
The first report produced gives averages since the last reboot.  Additional
reports give information on a sampling period of length
.IR delay .
The process and memory reports are instantaneous in either case.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I delay
The
.I delay
between updates in seconds.  If no
.I delay
is specified, only one report is printed with the average values since boot.
.TP
.I count
Number of updates.  In absence of
.IR count ,
when
.I delay
is defined, default is infinite.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-active\fR
Display active and  inactive memory, given a 2.5.41 kernel or better.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-forks\fR
The
.B \-f
switch displays the number of forks since boot.  This includes the fork,
vfork, and clone system calls, and is equivalent to the total number of tasks
created.  Each process is represented by one or more tasks, depending on
thread usage.  This display does not repeat.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-slabs\fR
Displays slabinfo.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-one-header\fR
Display the header only once rather than periodically.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stats\fR
Displays a table of various event counters and memory statistics.  This
display does not repeat.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-disk\fR
Report disk statistics (2.5.70 or above required).
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-disk-sum\fR
Report some summary statistics about disk activity.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partition\fR \fIdevice\fR
Detailed statistics about partition (2.5.70 or above required).
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-unit\fR \fIcharacter\fR
Switches outputs between 1000
.RI ( k ),
1024
.RI ( K ),
1000000
.RI ( m ),
or 1048576
.RI ( M )
bytes.  Note this does not change the swap (si/so) or block (bi/bo)
fields.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timestamp\fR
Append timestamp to each line
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-wide\fR
Wide output mode (useful for systems with higher amount of memory,
where the default output mode suffers from unwanted column breakage).
The output is wider than 80 characters per line.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-no-first\fR
Omits first report with statistics since system boot.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help and exit.

buff: the amount of memory used as buffers.
cache: the amount of memory used as cache.
inact: the amount of inactive memory.  (\fB\-a\fR option)
active: the amount of active memory.  (\fB\-a\fR option)
.fi
.SS Swap
These are affected by the \fB\-\-unit\fR option.
.nf

.SH FIELD DESCRIPTION FOR DISK MODE
.SS Reads
.nf
total: Total reads completed successfully
merged: grouped reads (resulting in one I/O)
sectors: Sectors read successfully
ms: milliseconds spent reading
.fi
.SS Writes
.nf
total: Total writes completed successfully
merged: grouped writes (resulting in one I/O)
sectors: Sectors written successfully
ms: milliseconds spent writing
.fi

.fi
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTION FOR DISK PARTITION MODE
.nf
reads: Total number of reads issued to this partition
read sectors: Total read sectors for partition
writes : Total number of writes issued to this partition
requested writes: Total number of write requests made for partition
.fi
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTION FOR SLAB MODE

about this information see

.fi
.SH NOTES
.B vmstat
requires read access to files under \fI/proc\fR. The \fB\-m\fR requires read
access to \fI/proc/slabinfo\fR which may not be available to standard users.
Mount options for \fI/proc\fR such as \fIsubset=pid\fR may also impact what
is visible.
