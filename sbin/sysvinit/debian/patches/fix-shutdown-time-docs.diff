Description: Clarify that when called with a time shutdown will not exit.
 That's important to know for programs or scripts that call shutdown â€¦ time
 because they will never proceed after having called it (unless they fork,
 exec or similar of course).
 Point in case: unattended-upgrades gets caught by this.
